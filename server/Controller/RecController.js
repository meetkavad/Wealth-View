            text: "I understand! I'll act as your personalized financial advisor at WealthView.  I can analyze daily income and expenses and give tailored recommendations without diving deep into specific goal planning. \n\nLet's assume I have access to your user database with the data fields you described. Here’s how I’d structure the daily financial advice:\n\n**Section Title: WealthView Daily Insights**\n\n**Personalization Header**\n\nDear [User Name],\n\nYour current financial snapshot shows:\n\n* **Total Income (this month):** ₹[amount]\n* **Total Expenses (this month):** ₹[amount] \n* **Overall Balance:** ₹[amount] ([Positive/Negative] trend this week) \n* **You're generally working towards:** [A brief, general overview of goals - e.g., \"Saving for a home,\" \"Early retirement,\" \"Building a diversified investment portfolio\"]. \n\n**Top Recommendations**\n\n1. **[Recommendation based on recent spending/income]**\n    * **Why this matters:** [Explain how the recommendation addresses a potential issue or opportunity – e.g., \"You've had higher restaurant expenses than usual. Let's look at ways to optimize this.\" Or, \"You received a bonus! Here are ways to make it work for you.\"]\n2. **[Recommendation based on overall financial health]**\n    * **Why this matters:** [Relate the recommendation to their overall finances,  e.g., \"Maintaining a healthy emergency fund is crucial. Consider adding to it if you're comfortable.\"] \n3. **[Recommendation based on previous recommendations/user behavior]**\n    * **Why this matters:** [If there are recurring patterns or if they haven't acted on past advice, address it here. E.g., \"You haven't reviewed your investment portfolio recently. Market changes might require adjustments.\"]\n\n**Disclaimer:** These recommendations are generated based on your recent financial activity and are meant for informational purposes only. Please review each recommendation and consult a qualified financial advisor before making any financial decisions.\n\n**Example**\n\n**WealthView Daily Insights**\n\n**Personalization Header**\n\nDear Priya, \n\nYour current financial snapshot shows:\n\n* **Total Income (this month):** ₹75,000\n* **Total Expenses (this month):** ₹50,000\n* **Overall Balance:**  ₹25,000 (Positive trend this week)\n* **You're generally working towards:** Saving for a down payment on a house.\n\n**Top Recommendations**\n\n1. **You've spent less on transportation this week.** \n    * **Why this matters:**  This is great! Since you're saving for a house, consider transferring the extra amount (₹[amount]) to your dedicated savings account. This will help you reach your goal faster.\n2. **Review your insurance policies.**\n    * **Why this matters:**  Having adequate insurance coverage is an essential part of financial health. Make sure you have the right home and health insurance, especially with your house purchase plans in mind. \n3. **Explore a recurring deposit (RD) for your down payment savings.** \n    * **Why this matters:** We noticed you haven't set up a recurring deposit yet. An RD can instill discipline and optimize your savings strategy. WealthView offers customizable RD options - let's find one that suits your needs.\n\n**Disclaimer:** These recommendations are generated based on your recent financial activity and are meant for informational purposes only. Please review each recommendation and consult a qualified financial advisor before making any financial decisions.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n* **Dynamic Data:** The recommendations must be generated based on daily changes in income and expenses. I'll need real-time access to your users' financial data.\n* **Algorithm Refinement:**  The recommendation algorithm will improve over time, learning from user interactions and financial data trends. \n* **User Feedback:**  Allow users to provide feedback on the recommendations. This will help refine the algorithm further.\n* **Integration with Goal Planner:**  Seamless integration with your goal planner manager will enhance the overall user experience. \n\nI believe with this approach, WealthView can provide valuable and personalized daily financial insights to your users.",
